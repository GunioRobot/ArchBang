<p><strong><u>About the Project</u></strong></p>
<p>ArchBang Linux is a simple GNU/Linux Operating System that combines 
the 
  lightweight Arch Linux with the fast and simple Openbox window 
manager via LXDE Desktop environment. It 
  reduces the entry barrier to using Arch, especially for new users, who
 might 
find the default Arch set-up process challenging or intimidating. </p>
<p>ArchBang GNU/Linux aims to provide
  an out-of-the-box Arch Linux
  experience with a pre-configured
  LXDE desktop suite, whilst being simple
  and adhering to The Arch Way, which is a set
  of principles that governs the development,
  maintenance and distribution process of Arch
  Linux (Simplicity, Code-correctness, Usercentric,
  Openness and Freedom). ArchBang is
  available in both 32-bit and 64-bit versions.
  The name ArchBang is inspired by
#!CrunchBang Linux.</p>
<p>The &quot;Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment&quot; is an extremely   fast-performing and energy-saving desktop environment. Maintained by an   international community of developers, it comes with a beautiful   interface, multi-language support, standard keyboard short cuts and   additional features like tabbed file browsing. LXDE uses less CPU and   less RAM than other environments. It is especially designed for cloud   computers with low hardware specifications, such as, netbooks, mobile   devices (e.g. MIDs) or older computers. LXDE can be installed with many   Linux distributions including Ubuntu, Debian and Fedora. It is the   standard for Knoppix and lubuntu. LXDE also runs with OpenSolaris and   BSD. LXDE provides a fast desktop experience; connecting easily with   applications in the cloud. LXDE supports a wealth of programs that can   be installed locally with Linux systems. The source code of LXDE is   licensed partly under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.txt">the General   Public License</a> and partly under the LGPL. </p>

<p><strong><u>About this Release</u></strong></p>
<p>This is a RC development build from the current GIT tree. This release is strictly 
meant for testing purposes and is not meant for production use. 
Eventually after testing is sufficient in September 2010 "apeiro" will 
be released.</p>

 GUIDE</a>.
<p><strong><u>System Requirements</u></strong></p>
<p>The minimum memory requirement for this release is 128 MB of memory 
and recommended 1 GB+ [since you may choose to install a lot of other 
applications requiring larger memory chunks. So just to be on the safer 
side as we can't predict what you will be installing]. Note that you 
must have more than 600 MB of memory for using the cp2ram feature. You 
will need either an i686 [32Bit] or a x86_64 [64Bit] Processor.</p>
<p> <u><strong>Installation</strong></u> </p>
<p>A standard Arch Linux system provides you with a very basic core 
installation. No desktop, Xorg, or video and hardware drivers are 
provided by default.  ArchBang provides a selection of carefully chosen 
and tested packages added to the base Arch Linux system, giving you a 
pre-installed and well-configured common set of video drivers [and also 
supplying the proprietary Nvidia driver as an optional package for users
 to choose to install], audio drivers [alsa] and a working Openbox based
 Desktop Environment, plus a myriad of tools available at your 
fingertips. ArchBang aims to get you started on your Arch Linux 
experience with a ready-made, usable desktop with minimal fuss. To know 
about the details of the packages included please check the <a 
href="http://archbang.org/Main/Features" target="_new">Features list</a>.</p>
<p> <u><strong>Known Issues</strong></u> </p>
<p>* While installation asks for partition options, "DON'T USE XFS as / 
or /boot!!" You have been warned!</p>
<p>* Grub-Legacy is deprecated and we don't maintain it nor do we have 
the time to fix any Grub-legacy related issues, so please don't ask for 
support. It has been kept because we were requested.</p>
<p><strong><u>Online Help</u></strong></p>
<p>Please visit our <a href="http://archbang.x.am/" target="_new">forum</a>
