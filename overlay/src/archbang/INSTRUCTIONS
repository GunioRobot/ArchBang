INSTRUCTIONS TO BUILD FROM GIT
------------------------------

REQUIREMENTS:
------------

1. Arch Linux or any Arch variant distribution pre-installed.
2. Git and ArchISO.
3. A working internet connection.
4. Working knowledge of Linux and a little time. :)

PREPARING THE SYSTEM
--------------------

(a) Building manually from AUR [Arch User Repository]

Go to http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=25996 and download the tarball. Or just open a terminal and type:

$ wget http://aur.archlinux.org/packages/archiso-git/archiso-git.tar.gz
$ tar xvf archiso-git.tar.gz
$ cd archiso-git
$ makepkg -sci PKGBUILD

This will install the archiso-git package.

(b) Build archiso-git by cloning GIT manually

$ git clone git://projects.archlinux.org/archiso.git
$ cd archiso/archiso
$ sudo make install
$ sudo pacman -S mkinitcpio cdrkit squashfs-tools devtools syslinux mkinitcpio-nfs-utils nbd

(c) Using Packer [RECOMMENDED]

Assuming you have packer it's as easy as:

$ packer -S archiso-git

Packer can be found here: http://aur.archlinux.org/packages.php?ID=33378

GETTING ARCHBANG
----------------

Go to the directory where you want to clone the ArchBang git tree. Let's assume your home directory here.

$ cd
$ git clone git://github.com/archbang/ArchBang.git

Done! That's pretty much it.

GETTING AUR PACKAGES
--------------------


(a) aurscript.sh

In the directory archbang/scripts  you will find aurscript.sh. Run it as root and it should automatically download and compile the packages for you.
Next add this to your /etc/pacman.conf as root:

[custom]
Server = file:///path/to/your/AUR/packages

(b) Using packer

Run:

$ packer -S $(cat packages.list.aur)

$ repo-add /path/to/packages/custom.db.tar.gz /path/to/packages/*.xz

Next add this to your /etc/pacman.conf as root:

[custom]
Server = file:///path/to/your/AUR/packages

(c) Manually

Get all the tarballs of the mentioned packages [except the ones whose PKGBUILDs are provided] and extract them in a directory one by one using:

$ tar xvf packagesname.tar.gz
$ cd packagesname

Now compile:

$ makepkg -sci PKGBUILD

This should install them for you as well and prompt for root password.

$ repo-add /path/to/packages/custom.db.tar.gz /path/to/packages/*.xz

Next add this to your /etc/pacman.conf as root:

[custom]
Server = file:///path/to/your/AUR/packages

CUSTOMIZING [optional]
-----------

You can add or remove packages from Arch Linux official repositories: http://www.archlinux.org/packages/
or AUR: http://aur.archlinux.org/ in the list packages.list or packages.list.aur respectively.
You can even change the ISOLINUX prompt by customizing boot-files/isolinux/isolinux.cfg.
Be creative! Have fun. :)

BUILDING
--------

Run as root or use sudo if you prefer.

# make all

Wait till it pulls in needed packages and dependencies. It depends on your download speed how fast the make process will complete.

When it's done you will have an archbang-$ver.iso in your archbang directory. You may remove the archbangftw directory.

# rm -rf archbangftw/

Now you can burn the ISO on a disk or dd to an USB or use in a virtualbox and check it out!
